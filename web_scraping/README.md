# Marvel Cinematic Universe Web Scraping Project

## Overview
This project aims to scrape data from the Marvel Cinematic Universe fandom wiki to collect information about movies and TV shows.

## Terms of Service and Scraping Policy
Before scraping data from the Marvel Cinematic Universe fandom wiki, I reviewed the site's terms of service and the `robots.txt` file.

- **robots.txt File**: The `robots.txt` file can be accessed [here](https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/robots.txt). It allows web crawlers to access most of the site while disallowing specific special pages.
- **Terms of Service**: The terms of service can be found [here](https://www.fandom.com/terms). I ensured that my scraping activities comply with their guidelines.
