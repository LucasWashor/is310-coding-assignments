# Marvel Cinematic Universe Web Scraping Project

For this assignment, we were required to scrape any fandom of our choosing! For my project, I chose to scrape the Marvel Cinematic Universe fandom page, located at [Marvel Cinematic Universe Fandom](https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe). 

The specific wiki pages I decided to scrape are the individual movie and TV show pages, as they contain detailed information about each title within the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

The robots.txt file for the Marvel Cinematic Universe fandom can be found here: [robots.txt](https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/robots.txt). The specific webpages we are scraping are within the allowed paths, ensuring compliance with the site's scraping policies.

With this project, I specifically wanted to gather information about the movies and TV shows in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, including their titles, release dates, box office earnings, genres, directors, and brief plot summaries. This data is interesting for researchers as it provides insights into the cinematic trends, financial success, and storytelling evolution within the franchise.
